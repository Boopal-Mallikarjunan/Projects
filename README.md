Projects | Voltam Electrik- Volektra
1. Improvement initiatives
	- 1kW to 1.5kW BLDC Motor winding pattern optimized and which results in 40% performance enhanced.
	- Worked on EESM project to build a prototypes, including miniature model windings.
	- Designed and developed test benches, test fixtures like 
		-Motor & Controller functional test benches
		-Back emf test fixtures
		-Differential axles test benches
	- Developed Retro fit kits for bikes & autos, enabling easy and quick conversion to fully electric vehicles
2. Project & process management
	- Led the team to develop the IC engine vehicles into fully electric.
	- Led the engineering team to prepare and maintain the process documents which includes BOM, Drawings, PFD, CP, PFMEA, ECN, CFT minutes, floorplan layout, packing standards and more.
	- Process optimisation- making adjustments to improve process efficiency, effectiveness and adaptability.
3. Testing, customization & troubleshooting
	- Led the team for the product validation testings'.
	- Collaborated with the team and analyse the test results and troubleshooting if any issues.
	- Initiating the cross functional team meetings for improvise the product and the process.
	- Modifying the firmware of the controllers as per the customer or project requirements and handled the software tools like CAN and non CAN based firmware tools.
4. Homologation certification process
	- Collaborated with the customers for the homologation certification processes like ARAI & ICAT.
5. Benchmarking through reverse engineering
	-  Had an hands-on experience in benchmarking the BLDC & PMSM motor and recreating through reverse engineering.
	- BLDC trapezoidal wave controller circuit tracking and localised the through hole component circuits.
